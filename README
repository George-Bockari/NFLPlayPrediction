In order to use our NFL Play Prediction, you will need to install the nflgame API with the following command:

sudo pip install nflgame

Another requirement is the scikit-learn package for Machine Learning operations:

sudo pip install scikit-learn

If you already have numpy and scipy installed, use the -U option in the previous command.

sudo pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl
