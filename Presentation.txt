1. Motivation (Roman)
What's the problem? Why is it interesting? What results do we expect?

2. Data (Roman)
What dataset do we use? How does the API work? 
Examples

3. Approach (Valentin)
Feature extraction: What features do we use? What plays are ignored?
Prediction: Probability of success? What's a success?
Which play has the highest probability of success in a certain situation?

4. ML Methods (Valentin)
What classifier do we use? How do we evaluate our results?
Classification (Success / Fail): SVM
Regression (Yards): SVR
Dimensionality reduction: PCA
Prediction: Play with highest probability of success
Evaluation: k-fold cross validation


5. Timeline (Valentin)
About 5 weeks
-> Now: Feature extraction
-> 2 weeks: Finish basic implementation 
-> 4 weeks: Evaluating results, Comparing different classifiers, Parameter tuning, Writing report
-> Finishing Report, Presentation
